Electronic and Digital systems may use a variety of different number systems, (e.g. Decimal, Hexadecimal, Octal, Binary).

A number N in base or radix b can be written as:
(N)b = dn-1 dn-2 — — — — d1 d0 . d-1 d-2 — — — — d-m

In the above, dn-1 to d0 is integer part, then follows a radix point, and then d-1 to d-m is fractional part.

dn-1 = Most significant bit (MSB)

d-m = Least significant bit (LSB)
The same logic of conversions is used in programs as they are performed during manual computation.
